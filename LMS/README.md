## A Couple of Specific Things to Note Regarding LMS Installation

**_LMS Playlists_**

- For local LMS playlists, the playlists name **cannot** include spaces.  Please ensure your playlist names use underscores rather than spaces.  So some of mine include:
  - Classic_Rock
  - Jazz_Vocals
  - Old_time_Country

**_Radio Stations_**

- For radio station support, I cheated. Essentially radio stations are pre-defined in LMS as a playlist with following the naming format: Radio_StationName all in Title Case. So some of mine include:
  - Radio_Cbc
  - Radio_Q92
  - Radio_Country_Classics
- Seemed like the easiest way to get there from here. This way all the linking is inside LMS.

**_Spotify_**
- The plugin `Spotty` is required for Spotify music source to work
- At this time, I believe only PAID subscriptions will work with the full query features.
- Further testing will be done to see what can be made to work with the free version
